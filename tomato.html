    <h1 id="what">What Is Tomato?</h1>
    <p id="p">The tomato is the edible berry of the plant 
        Solanum lycopersicum,commonly known 
        as the tomato plant. The species originated
        in western South America, Mexico,and Central America.
        Its domestication and use as a cultivated
        food may have originated with the indigenous
        peoples of Mexico.The Aztecs used
        tomatoes in their cooking at the time of
        the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire,
        and after the Spanish encountered the
        tomato for the first time after their
        contact with the Aztecs, they brought
        the plant to Europe, in a widespread
        cultural interchange known as the 
        Columbian exchange. From there, the
        tomato was introduced to other parts
        of the European-colonized world during
        the 16th century.</p>
